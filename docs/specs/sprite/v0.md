# Sprite File Specification

This document describes the format for sprite files readable by latebit. It serves as a reference for current and future implementations.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Status</th><td>Stable</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Version</th><td>v0.1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Updates and Versioning

This specification follows semantic versioning: the first digit indicates breaking changes, the second indicates backward-compatible updates.

Backward-compatible updates will be added to this document and marked as such.

Breaking changes can be found in `vN.md`, where `N` is the major version.

## Terminology

* **Sprite**: A graphical object composed of one or more keyframes, displayed sequentially to create an animation. It may represent a character, item, or any visual game element.

* **Keyframe**: An image representing a distinct visual state within a sprite's animation sequence.

* **Cell**: The basic unit of a keyframe, representing a single color "dot". It can be scaled to an nxn pixel square. The sprite's dimensions determine cell arrangement.

## Specification
A sprite file has the following structure:

```
#v0.1#
2
5
5
10
-777-
7---7
7---7
7---7
-777-
-----
-77--
7--7-
7--7-
-77--
```

### Header
The first 5 lines comprise the file header:

#### Version
Line 1: Sprite format version. Used by interpreters to identify which parsing rules to apply.

#### Keyframe Count
Line 2: Total number of keyframes in the sprite.

#### Sprite Width
Line 3: Width of the sprite in cells (uniform across all keyframes).

#### Sprite Height
Line 4: Height of the sprite in cells (uniform across all keyframes).

> **Note**: All keyframes must have identical dimensions as specified in the header.

#### Keyframe Duration
Line 5: Display duration of each keyframe in frames. E.g., at 60 fps, a duration of 60 means 1 second per keyframe.


> **Note**: Comments can be added to the header by prefixing lines with `#`. 
> Example:
>   ```
>   2 # keyframes
>   3 # width
>   ```

### Body

The remainder of the file is its body. 

It follows the header and defines the keyframes:

- Each character represents one cell.
- Valid characters:
  * `0-F`: Hexadecimal digits representing one of [16 colors](https://github.com/latebit/latebit-engine/blob/d2bf980296265454e4f925ad31a96afad9bf8874/latebit/core/graphics/Colors.h#L6-L24).
  * `-`: Represents transparency.
- Each line must contain exactly the number of characters specified by the sprite width.
- Each keyframe consists of the number of lines specified by the sprite height.
- The total number of lines must equal (sprite height * number of keyframes).
